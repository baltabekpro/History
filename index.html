    <h1>История Казахстана</h1>

    <p><strong>1. Kazakhstan in the postwar years</strong></p>
    <p>After the war, Kazakhstan faced many difficulties. Transitioning to peaceful life was hard, especially in the economy. Factories that produced military products had to switch to peaceful production. For example, agriculture lacked machinery, fertilizers, and workers, which made it difficult to restore food production. The situation was worsened by nuclear tests at the Semipalatinsk Test Site. These tests not only destroyed the environment but also caused severe diseases such as cancer and congenital disabilities among the population.</p>

    <p>Despite this, positive changes occurred in education and science. In 1946, the Academy of Sciences of Kazakhstan was established, including prominent figures like Kanysh Satpayev. Scientists began exploring the country's natural resources, such as coal, oil, and gas reserves. This laid the foundation for industrial development.</p>

    <p>In politics, changes began after Stalin’s death. His cult of personality was criticized at the 20th Congress of the CPSU in 1956, and some repressed figures, like Turar Ryskulov and Saken Seifullin, were partially rehabilitated. However, the rehabilitation process was incomplete: many did not receive full justice, and the true causes of repression remained hidden.</p>

    <p>N.S. Khrushchev’s reforms were also inconsistent. For instance, attempts to improve governance led to the creation of sovnarkhozy (regional economic councils), but this further complicated the system. In 1959, worker unrest in Temirtau over low wages and poor working conditions highlighted the failures of these reforms. The return of Kazakh repatriates in 1955 and 1962, such as families from China, was also accompanied by difficulties, as there were not enough jobs and housing for them.</p>

    <p>In agriculture, administrative management methods, such as the Virgin Lands Campaign, temporarily increased harvests but ultimately worsened the ecological situation. Due to improper land use, the soil became less fertile, leading to new food supply problems.</p>

    <p>The economic reforms of 1965–1966, such as plans to increase labor productivity, were not fully implemented. As a result, stores lacked basic goods. Internal migration policies also created challenges. For example, the passport system prevented Kazakhs from moving from villages to cities, limiting their opportunities for education and employment.</p>

    <p>Despite these difficulties, Kazakhstan made a significant contribution to the USSR’s industry. For example, the Karaganda coal basin supplied coal to the entire country, and the metallurgical plant in Temirtau produced steel for Soviet factories.</p>

    <p>Cultural and spiritual life faced contradictions. For instance, administrative control hindered the development of national literature, yet signs of Kazakh identity revival emerged. Organizations like “Zhastulpar” united students interested in Kazakhstan’s history and culture. Writers such as Mukhtar Shakhanov, Olzhas Suleimenov, and Ilyas Yesenberlin raised issues of national pride and historical memory in their works.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Что ты понял?</strong><br>
        I understood that after the war, Kazakhstan had many problems, like in economy, agriculture, and politics. There were nuclear tests, environmental crises, and difficulties in culture and national identity. Some changes were good, like education and science, but many reforms were incomplete.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Какую пользу принес тебе текст?</strong><br>
        The text helped me learn about Kazakhstan’s history, problems, and achievements after the war. It shows how people worked hard for progress and how national identity started to grow.</p>

    <p><strong>2. The policy of "perestroika" in Kazakhstan</strong></p>
    <p>The policy of "perestroika" in Kazakhstan brought significant changes in ideology, economics, and politics. Initiated by M.S. Gorbachev, these reforms aimed to modernize the Soviet system but led to numerous challenges. For example, the introduction of glasnost allowed open discussions about national issues, which highlighted economic problems and triggered national conflicts in many Soviet republics. In Kazakhstan, this period exposed the economic crisis, as the central union administration struggled to adapt to the new reforms. Some state-owned enterprises were returned to national republics, but this was not enough to stabilize the economy.</p>

    <p>Another critical event during this time was the Afghan war (1979-1989), where many Kazakhs participated as Soviet soldiers. This war drained resources and deeply affected the lives of those involved, leaving a lasting impact on Kazakhstan.</p>

    <p>D.A. Kunaev played a significant role in Kazakhstan's political life during perestroika, but his dismissal as the First Secretary of the Communist Party sparked protests. The most notable event was the December 1986 uprising in Alma-Ata (now Almaty), where people protested against the appointment of an outsider, Gennady Kolbin, to replace Kunaev. This marked one of the first major movements for national self-determination in the USSR.</p>

    <p>During this time, the leaders of the Alash movement, who had been previously repressed, were officially rehabilitated, symbolizing a growing recognition of Kazakhstan’s national identity. New public organizations and political parties began to emerge, reflecting the increasing demand for democratic reforms.</p>

    <p>Significant legislative changes also occurred. The adoption of the "Law on Language" declared Kazakh as the state language, emphasizing its importance in national identity. The Declaration on State Sovereignty of the Kazakh SSR marked a crucial step towards independence, showing Kazakhstan's desire to control its political and economic future.</p>

    <p>The August coup of 1991, which attempted to restore Communist Party control, failed and led to the termination of the Communist Party’s activities. Shortly after, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Kazakhstan became part of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), marking the beginning of a new chapter in its history.</p>

    <p><strong>1. What did you understand?</strong><br>
        I understood that perestroika brought many changes to Kazakhstan in politics, economy, and national identity. Important events like the 1986 December protests and the collapse of the USSR shaped Kazakhstan’s future.</p>

    <p><strong>2. What benefit did the text give you?</strong><br>
        The text taught me about Kazakhstan's struggles and progress during perestroika. I learned how people fought for independence and national identity.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Declaration of independence of Kazakhstan and the state system of the Republic of Kazakhstan</strong></p>
    <p>The Declaration of Independence of Kazakhstan on December 16, 1991, officially ended the country’s reliance on the Soviet Union. Before gaining independence, Kazakhstan faced a challenging socio-political situation. The first national presidential elections took place in December 1991, where Nursultan Nazarbayev was elected President, giving the country its first democratically chosen leader. Soon after, the Constitutional Law "On State Independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan" was adopted, legally confirming Kazakhstan's sovereignty.</p>

    <p>One of the first steps in building the new state was creating national symbols. The flag, with its sky-blue color and golden sun and eagle, represented peace and freedom. The coat of arms, with its image of shanyrak (the central part of a yurt), symbolized unity and heritage. The national anthem, chosen later, became a source of pride and inspiration for the people.</p>

    <p>To ensure security, the Law on the Creation of the Armed Forces was passed, establishing Kazakhstan's own army in January 1992. This was vital for defending the newly determined borders of the country. The process of delimitation and demarcation of state borders was completed by 2005, providing stability and clarity in Kazakhstan’s relations with neighboring states like Russia and China.</p>

    <p>Economic independence was another priority. In 1993, the government introduced the tenge, Kazakhstan’s national currency, to replace the Soviet ruble. This allowed the country to manage its own economy and stabilize financial systems during a challenging transition period.</p>

    <p>Political reforms followed, with the adoption of the current Constitution in 1995 after a national referendum. The Constitution established a presidential-parliamentary system and strengthened the protection of citizens' rights. Decentralization reforms allowed regional governments to have more control over local issues, balancing power between the central and regional levels.</p>

    <p>Law enforcement institutions were also created, including the court system, prosecutor’s office, police, and special security services. Reforms focused on protecting human rights and making laws more humane. For example, the Law "On Combating Corruption," passed in 1998, aimed to address systemic corruption by creating strict penalties and monitoring systems.</p>

    <p>Kazakhstan's progress in strengthening national identity was reflected in its promotion of civil peace and political stability. Education programs and cultural projects emphasized the importance of preserving Kazakh traditions while integrating into the global community.</p>

    <p><strong>1. What did you understand?</strong><br>
        I understood that Kazakhstan declared independence in 1991 and worked hard to create its state. The country introduced a new currency, formed an army, set its borders, and adopted a Constitution to protect citizens and develop democracy.</p>

    <p><strong>2. What benefit did the text give you?</strong><br>
        The text showed me how Kazakhstan overcame many challenges to build a strong and independent state. I learned specific examples, like creating the tenge and passing the anti-corruption law, which helped develop the country.</p>
